# AI & Machine Learning Implementations

Model implementation and experimentation of various Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms and techniques I learn!

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is logically divided into the following core domains of AI/ML:

- **`1_traditional_machine_learning/`**: Foundational algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs, and ensemble methods.
- **`2_natural_language_processing/`**: NLP models for processing and understanding human language, including tokenization, embeddings, and model architectures.
- **`3_computer_vision/`**: Models for image processing, object detection, image classification, and more.
- **`4_reinforcement_learning/`**: Implementations of agents, environments, and algorithms like Q-Learning and Policy Gradients.
- **`6_data_generation/`**: Models and techniques for generating synthetic data, including GANs and VAEs.
- **`7_others/`**: Miscellaneous algorithms and utilities that don't fit into the above categories.
