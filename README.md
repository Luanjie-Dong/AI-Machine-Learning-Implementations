## Overview
A comprehensive repository documenting my hands-on implementation and experimentation with AI/ML algorithms!

## Implementations
| Implementation | Description | 
|---------|-------------|
| **Traditional Machine Learning** - [View Code](https://github.com/Luanjie-Dong/AI-ML-Implementations/tree/main/01_traditional_machine_learning) | Implementations of foundational algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Includes ensemble methods. |
| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** - [View Code](https://github.com/Luanjie-Dong/AI-ML-Implementations/tree/main/02_natural_language_processing)| NLP models designed for processing and understanding human language. Covers tokenization, embeddings, and various model architectures.
| **Computer Vision** - [View Code](https://github.com/Luanjie-Dong/AI-ML-Implementations/tree/main/03_computer_vision)| Models for image processing tasks like object detection, image classification, and more advanced computer vision techniques. 
| **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** - [View Code](https://github.com/Luanjie-Dong/AI-ML-Implementations/tree/main/04_reinforcement_learning)| Implementations of RL agents, environments, and algorithms, including Q-Learning and Policy Gradients, designed to allow agents to learn through interaction with an environment.
| **Data Generation** - [View Code](https://github.com/Luanjie-Dong/AI-ML-Implementations/tree/main/others/data_generation/model)| Models and techniques for generating synthetic data, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). 
| **Cross Validation Methods** - [View Code](https://github.com/Luanjie-Dong/AI-ML-Implementations/tree/main/others/cross_validation)| Implementations of k-fold and stratified k-fold cross-validation techniques for robust model evaluation.
| **Optimization Methods** - [View Code](https://github.com/Luanjie-Dong/AI-ML-Implementations/tree/main/others/optimisation)| Includes Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Search techniques for hyperparameter optimization. 
| **Regularization Techniques** - [View Code](https://github.com/Luanjie-Dong/AI-ML-Implementations/tree/main/others/regularisation)| L1, L2, and ElasticNet regularization methods to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
